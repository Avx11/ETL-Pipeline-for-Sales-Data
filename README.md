ETL Pipeline for Sales Data: From CSV to Database 

This ETL pipeline extracts sales data from a CSV file, transforms it by cleaning dates and text fields (like product names),
and loads the processed data into a MySQL database. Using Python (Pandas for data handling and SQLAlchemy for database connections),
the workflow automates the conversion of raw sales records into structured, queryable database tablesâ€”ready for analysis or reporting.
